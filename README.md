# College-Enrollment-System

Project simulates creating accounts, searching and enrolling in courses from database, as well as my own, never before seen (to my knowledge) feature - Smart Scheduling.

BuildSmartSchedule.png - Shows how to input course names (comma-separated) in order to build a smart schedule.

Schedules.png - Shows the result after performing the search using the Smart Schedule option.

SmartResult.png - Shows what happens when you click enroll on one of the schedules (first schedule from Schedules.png, in this case).
